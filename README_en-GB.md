# homebrew-vchewing

## Description

homebrew-vchewing is a Homebrew Cask for installing/uninstalling [vChewing-macOS](https://github.com/vChewing/vChewing-macOS).

## Version

At present, the update method of this Cask is manual synchronization. That is, every time a new version is released, I manually update the version number and sha256 here, so in some cases (such as sleeping, going to school, or traveling) it may not be updated immediately. If you find that the version number and sha256 below have not been updated within 24 hours, please alert me via [Issues](https://github.com/windwords/homebrew-vchewing/issues), [Email](mailto:windwords001@gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/windwords001), etc.
